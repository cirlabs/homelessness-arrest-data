## Categorizing Housing Status

- `housing_status.ipynb`
  - Uses fake data to explain the process, as people's real addresses will be kept private.

- `unhoused_addresses.csv`
  - Address data from arrests for which I categorized arrestees as unhoused. Note that if the information corresponds to a real address, I omitted the number of associated arrests so these organizations would not receive undue attention. I explain what proportion of each city's arrests corresponds to a real address in the notes field for each address.

  | City        | (Rounded) percent of unhoused arrests for which data was a real address  | (Rounded) percent of unhoused arrests where data was a keyword like "transient" or "homeless" |
